When a ruby test file with your cursor within a test block, hit
<leader>.
(that's <leader><period>) and that test, and only that test, will run in quickfix.
That's it!

Currently only supports Test::Unit and Rspec.  If run on an Rspec describe block it will run all the tests in that block (just using existing spec command-line functionality for that one).

The script is also hosted on GitHub:
